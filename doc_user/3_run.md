# Run Shiny Applications

After successful installation, the new project will appear in the list of installed apps. You can run an app on your computer by clicking the button **App**. Then go to **Intalled apps**, scroll down to the app you wish to run, and click on it.

When applications are running, they are displayed in a browser window embed within your app window. Meanwhile, notice that a sign, “listening on ...”, appears in the Console window while your app is running, indicating the current R session is busy running your application. 

Now we have a running application.
