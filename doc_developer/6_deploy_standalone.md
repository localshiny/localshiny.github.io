# Deploy standalone Applications

In addition to __LocalShiny__ R package, you can upload a standalone desktop application via the website directly. The users installing it need not have R and any other required packages to install and run the app. It is a portable version of the app.

Bundle the app you wish to distribute as a standalone desktop application, with an installer file. The application files must be in zip format. Then log into the LocalShiny website, go to your account profile, and click the **New App** below.
